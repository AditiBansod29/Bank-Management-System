The Bank Management System is a simple console-based project built in the C programming language.  
It allows users to perform essential banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, checking balances, and displaying all customer details.  
All records are stored permanently in a file using file handling, making it a great beginner-friendly project for understanding data persistence in C.

Feature and information we learned while doing this project are:
Structures in C (to store account details)  
File Handling (`fopen`, `fread`, `fwrite`, `fseek`)  
Loops and Conditional Statements 
Functions and Modular Programming
